+5 to hit (Reach 5 ft; One Creature).
Hit, 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage, and the stirge attaches to the target. While attached, the stirge doesn’t attack.
Instead, at the start of each of the stirge’s turn, the target loses 5 (1d4+3) hit points due to blood loss.
The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of
blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge.
