Traits
Devil’s Sight, Magical darkness doesn’t impede the imp’s darkvision.
Shapechanger, The imp can use its action to polymorph into the beast form of a rat, a raven, or a spider, or into its
devil form. Its statistics are the same in each form, although its attack is different in some of them. Any equipment it
carries is not transformed. If slain, the imp reverts to its devil form.
Magic Resistance, The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Actions
Sting (Bite in Beast Form) ­ Melee Weapon Attack
+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
Hit, 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10
(3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Invisibility, The imp turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends. Anything the invisible imp is carrying
or wearing is invisible as long as it remains in contact with the imp.
