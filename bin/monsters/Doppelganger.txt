Read Thoughts, The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect
can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it.
While the target is within range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts as long as the doppelganger’s
concentration isn’t broken. While reading the target’s mind the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and
Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.
