Longsword ­ Melee Weapon Attack
+2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit, 1 slashing damage.
Shortbow ­ Ranged Weapon Attack
+6 to hit, range 40 ft./160 ft., one target.
Hit, 1 piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the target falls unconscious for the same
duration, or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.
Heart Sight, The sprite touches a creature and knows the creature’s current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10
Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail
the saving throw.
Invisibility, The sprite turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends. Anything the
invisible sprite is carrying or wearing is invisible as long as it remains in contact with the sprite.
