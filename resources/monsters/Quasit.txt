Traits
Magic Resistance, The quasit has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Shapechanger, The quasit can use its action to polymorph into the beast form of a bat, centipede, or toad, or into its
demon form. Its statistics are the same in each form, although its attack is different in some of them. Any equipment it
carries is not transformed. If slain, the quasit reverts to its demon form.
Actions
Claws (Bite in Beast Form) ­ Melee Weapon Attack
+4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit, 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving
throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on a success.
Scare (1/Day), One creature of the quasit’s choice within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw
or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if
the quasit is within line of sight, ending the effect early on a success.
Invisibility, The quasit turns invisible until it attacks or uses Scare, or until its concentration ends. Anything the
invisible quasit is carrying or wearing is invisible as long as it remains in contact with the quasit.
